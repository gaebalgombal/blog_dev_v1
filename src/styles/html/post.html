                Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web
                applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces,
                and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the
                hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures
                tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more.
                This allows you to focus on building your application instead of
                spending time with configuration. Whether you're an individual
                developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build
                interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications. Next.js is a

                automatically configures tooling needed for React, like
                bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on
                building your application instead of spending time with
                configuration. Whether you're an individual developer or part of
                a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic,
                and fast React applications.
