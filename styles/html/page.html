            Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web
            applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and
            Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood,
            Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed
            for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to

            configuration. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a
